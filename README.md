# Neural Network Project – Educational Demonstration

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of neural networks for a classification or prediction task. The project focuses on fundamental steps such as data loading, preprocessing, training, and visualization, intended for academic learning or portfolio presentation.

## 📁 Project Files

- `Neural networks.ipynb` — Main notebook that builds and evaluates the neural network model
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies required to run the notebook
- `README.md` — Project overview and usage instructions (this file)

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Load and explore data using pandas and numpy
- Train a neural network model (custom or scikit-learn-based)
- Visualize results using matplotlib
- (Optional) Save and load models using Python's `pickle`

## 🧪 Requirements

The following Python packages are used in the notebook:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
